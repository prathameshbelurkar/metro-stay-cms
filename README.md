## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the application. Below is a list of the environment variables required by this project:

- `VITE_API_URL`: The base URL for the API.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file in the root of your project**: This file should not be committed to source control as it contains sensitive information.

2. **Add the required environment variables**: Use the provided `.env.example` as a reference.

Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```bash
# .env.example
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
